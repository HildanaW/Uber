# Introduction 
For this project I analyzed the number of Uber rides and displayed trends in the day, week, month and year.

data_combined$second = factor(second(hms(data_combined$Time)))

# Data Analysis üìä

To create the charts, I grouped the table by each respective time format needed(hour, month, day of week) and used each one to create a chart.
```R
#Chart 1:By the Hour 

data_by_hour <- data_combined %>% 
  group_by(hour) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(data_by_hour, aes(hour, Total)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", 
           fill="pink", 
           color="blue") + 
  ggtitle("Trips by the Hour") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)

#Chart2: Trips by Month

data_by_month <- data_combined %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(data_by_month, aes(month, Total, fill=month)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  ggtitle("Trips by  Month") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)

#Chart3:Trips by hour and Month
month_hour_data <- data_combined %>% 
  group_by(month, hour) %>%  
  dplyr::summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(month_hour_data, aes(hour, Total, fill=month)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  ggtitle("Trips by Hour and Month") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)


#Chart4:Trips everyday of the Month(Max 31 days)
data_by_day <- data_combined %>% group_by(day) %>% dplyr::summarize(Trips = n())
ggplot(data_by_day, aes(day, Trips)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  ggtitle("Trips by day of the month") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)


#Chart5:Day of week and Month

day_month_data <- data_combined %>% 
  group_by(dayofweek, month) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(Trips = n())


ggplot(day_month_data, aes(dayofweek, Trips, fill = month)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = month), position = "dodge") + 
  ggtitle("Trips by Day of Week and Month") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors)

# Chart 6 :Trips by Bases and Month 
Base_month_data <- data_combined %>% group_by(month,Base) %>% dplyr::summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(Base_month_data, aes(Base, Total, fill=month)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "Identity",aes(fill = month), position = "dodge" ) + 
  ggtitle("Trips by Base and Month") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors)


```
Similarly, I  grouped the table by each respective time format needed(hour, month, day of week) to create heat maps as follows:

```R
# Heatmap1:by hr and day
day_hour_data <- data_combined %>% group_by(day, hour) %>% dplyr::summarize(Total = n())
ggplot(day_hour_data, aes(day, hour, fill = Total)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Heat Map of Trips by Hour and Day")

# Heatmap2:by month and day,

month_day_data <- data_combined %>% group_by(month, day) %>% dplyr::summarize(Trips = n())
ggplot(month_day_data, aes(day, month, fill = Trips)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Heat Map of Trips by Month and Day")

#Heatmap3:by month and week day,

ggplot(day_month_data, aes(dayofweek, month, fill = Trips)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Heat Map of Trips by Month and Week Day")

#Heatmap4:by Bases and weekday
Base_week_data <- data_combined %>% group_by(dayofweek,Base) %>% dplyr::summarize(Total = n())
ggplot(Base_week_data , aes(dayofweek, Base, fill = Total)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Heat Map by Base and Day of Week") 
  
  

#Heatmap5:By month and Week day
ggplot(day_month_data, aes(month, dayofweek, fill = Trips)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Heat Map by Month and Week Day")

```

# Conclusion
1. There is a significant increase in teh number of uber rides from earlier in the day to 4pm/ 5pm which could be expalined by the end of the the work day. </br>
2. The number of rides has an increasing trend as we go later in the year. Some reasons for this could be the weather or which period of the school year it is. </br>
3. There is also a pattern looking at the rides in a week. Fridays and Saturdays have a higher number possibly due to people going out, meeting up or getting groceries after the work week is over. As for Tuesday, one hypotheis could be that people with hybrid schedules are more likeley to take Monday or Fridays off as oppose dto the middle of the week as it adds to their weekend. </br>
